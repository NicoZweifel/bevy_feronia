# bevy_feronia

Foliage/Grass Wind simulation shaders/materials that prioritise visual fidelity/artistic freedom and modularity. 

> [!CAUTION]
> This package is in very early development, api's will most likely change and be modularized. The performance isn't great for most scenarios atm and in general it is not stable.

### Roadmap

- Texture based Scattering.
- Manual GPU Instancing.
- Compute Shaders for procedural grass (covering areas).
- Performance Improvements (e.g. skip calculations for LODs) / Shortcuts (e.g. procedurally defined geometry instead of calculating neighbor pos)
